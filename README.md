We integrate open-source software for you to pay less in long-term and own your data.
## Mission

We believe that p2p services based on open-source is better, than unfair-priced SaaS products within shared economy.

Imagine your Uber taxi stops, catches another person, makes a detour and only then finishes the ride.
Or AirBnB decides that a stranger will live in the place you're renting, because it's "optimal".

Digital SaaS companies make this every single day.

## If my team won't like it, can I migrate back to GitHub/Trello/Slack?

Yes, we are _aginst any vendor-lock_ (if target-saas is welcoming digital nomads)

## Can I migrate back to another free open-source solution?

Yes, because you own your data and free to move it anywhere else, anytime.

## Should I run a server/vps?

Yes, but we're thinking towards a federated solution w/o a central server.
