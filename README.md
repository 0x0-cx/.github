## If my team won't like it, can I migrate back to GitHub/Trello/Slack?

Yes, we are _aginst any vendor-lock_ (if target-saas is welcoming digital nomads)

## Can I migrate back to another free open-source solution?

Yes, because you own your data and free to move it anywhere else, anytime.

## Should I run a server/vps?

Yes, but we're thinking towards a federated solution w/o a central server.
